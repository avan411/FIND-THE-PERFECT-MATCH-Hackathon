Human connection is hard to come by. This is a potential solution to the problem.

# Why the theme Hobbies/Interests?
We chose Hobbies/Interests for our theme as we really saw the value in personalizing and shaping the experience in the direction of our users. We noticed throughout university, it was super easy to make friends when interests aligned or common experiences were shared. Through our app, our mission is to connect like-minded individuals and to provide a platform for networking, relationship-building and to simply make life-long friends.
